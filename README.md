# Suite Hearts - The housing app for roommates
CS 147L final project - Destiny Tran Saucedo-Martinez, Celeste Ayleen Noriega, Stephanie Cho

Our app tackles communal living and short term housing needs - subleasing, renting, dorm living. Too short of a time and too expensive to find an apartment, but too long to stay in a hotel or airbnb - find your next mid-term stay on Suite Hearts, and spend that time with people you're compatbile living with. No more random roommate nightmares, shady craigslist deals, or scouring facebook marketplace. Find roommates, find a host, and figure out your next living situation - where it be for an internship, school, study abroad, or work.
